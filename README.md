Simple web app to create a spotify playlist with the top 15 most listened songs from the past 4 weeks.

It was mainly made for personal use but it is available at: https://spotify-top-tracks-5jdx4f7qr-jose-silvas-projects-c699702d.vercel.app/

[IMPORTANT]: since the spotify web api does not allow non-business accounts to deploy apps in production, spotify account email is required to use the app.
